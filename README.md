So this is a next js application for a Cursor for video making type application and it will be used to create animated videos like 3 blue 1 brown. 
It uses chatgpt and other LLMs to write Manim Code (https://www.manim.community/) and then executes it to get a video file which is then shown to the user .. The user can then reiterate on the video to then work ahead and get better videos and more detailed videos upon talking to the chatbot and retierating on the code.
